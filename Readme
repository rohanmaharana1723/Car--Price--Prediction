#  Car Price Prediction

An interactive machine learning project that predicts the price of automobiles
based on their specifications using a trained regression model and a Streamlit 
web application.

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Preprocess and clean automobile data
- Handle outliers and missing values
- Encode categorical features
- Train regression models to predict car prices
- Deploy a user-friendly web application using Streamlit

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Modeling:** Multiple regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with evaluation metrics.
- **Web Application:** Streamlit app to input car specifications and predict the price in real-time.
